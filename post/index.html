</code></pre></div><p>Recap
I transitioned between companies for the first time, and now have the perspective of two cultures. Being part of a company that is raising money ($150M from a16z), hiring (222% in 1 year), and closing new business (14 new logos) is far more interesting than one where people and customers are leaving. Both come with their own challenges and opportunities, but having seen the different ends of the spectrum I will be much quicker to move on in the future.</p><p>I met with one of Atlanta’s top venture capitalist’s and he shared his perspective of his role in the ecosystem. I was amazed by his ability to articulate what he needs to see in order to invest in a company, so that he can support their growth and exit with a return. Within an hour he knows if it’s a good fit. He values a founder’s understanding of their business’s metrics, customer obsession, and exit opportunities in 3-5 years.</p><p>Plenty has been written about the importance of company culture and for good reason. Operating in a group that values transparency, high agency, and continuous improvement unlocks the potential for better ideas, feedback, and customer’s success. It’s similar to team chemistry in sports versus a group of individuals playing for themselves. The people within a company should strongly hold the same core values, while maintaining diversity of ideas.</p><p>Learnings
Forecasting. Setting goals and achieving them is the expectation from investors, executives, and customers. Forecasting accurately is the best way to be recognized as reliable and move up.
It’s a flywheel. Work, health, family, and friends are all connected. If one of those areas is going poorly the rest suffer. The opposite holds true, so it’s important to focus time and energy appropriately so they can reinforce each other. With an unlimited number of things to do, identifying what’s important and driving towards set goals is constant.
Build something people love. Creating something users want is the most important thing. Everything else flows from this and exists to make other people successful.
Onward
Technology will continue to shape our shared future, and I hope to play a direct role in it, while empowering others to do the same. How can I fulfill my potential? How can I maximize my impact on other people? For now it’s accomplishing Sourcegraph’s mission, creating a world so everyone can code.</p><p>“You can&rsquo;t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving." - Paul Kalanithi</p></section></p></section><footer class=post-meta><img class=author-thumb src=https://kevin-quigley.github.io/website/images/user.png alt="Author image" nopin=nopin>
