Being part of a company that is raising money ($150M from a16z), hiring (222% in 1 year), and closing new business (14 new logos) is far more interesting than one where people and customers are leaving. Both come with their own challenges and opportunities, but having seen the different ends of the spectrum I will be much quicker to move on in the future.</description></item></channel></rss>
